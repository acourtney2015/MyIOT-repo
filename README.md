A repo to hold my internet of things code

Some of the code in this repo was originally found from Hacksterio https://www.hackster.io/DeanJezard/the-connected-beer-fridge-853b27?ref=part&ref_id=13747&offset=0
Hat tip and acknowledgement to Dean Jezard for sharing the base code that I am playing with


Connecting a device button using AWS and Slack to tell your crew it is o'beer thirty with a push of a button
![beer image](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/image/file/115892/ConnectedBeerFridge_Icons.png?w=1280&h=960&fit=max)

The initial process from Hacksterio goes like this:  

An AWS IoT button is attached to the beer fridge.  
When it's party time, tap your device button.  A message will be sent by the button's wifi connection to the cloud to the AWS IoT platform which in turn will invoke a Node.js Lambda function.  
The Lambda function will fetch a random animated gif from the Giphy API and post it into your Slack channel.  
All subscribers of the Slack channel will get a notification informing them that it's beer o'clock, party time!

I will use this repo to play with the code and try to make something new.....Let the fun begin
